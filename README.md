# A complete relational database for a Library Management System built with MySQL.

# Library Management System Database

## Description
This project implements a complete relational database for managing a library system using MySQL. It includes tables for books, members, loans, reservations, book reviews, and authors, with appropriate relationships and constraints.


## How to Run/Setup (or Import SQL)
1. Ensure you have a MySQL server running.
2. You can import the database schema by executing the `library_management_system.sql` file using a MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Command Line Client, MySQL Workbench, Dbeaver). For example, using the command line:
   ```bash
   mysql -u <your_username> -p <your_database_name> < library_management_system.sql
   ```
   Replace `<your_username>` with your MySQL username and `<your_database_name>` with the name of the database you want to create or use.
